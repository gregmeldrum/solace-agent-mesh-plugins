## Overview

The Bright Data plugin enables SAM to interact with Bright Data's web scraping and data collection services. This allows you to extract data from websites, access public web data, and perform web intelligence gathering tasks directly through your SAM orchestrator. The plugin leverages Bright Data's robust infrastructure for reliable and compliant data collection.

## Features

This agent provides the following capabilities:

- **Web Scraping**: Extract structured data from websites
- **Data Collection**: Access public web data at scale
- **Website Interaction**: Automate interactions with web pages
- **Proxy Networks**: Leverage Bright Data's proxy infrastructure for reliable access

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `BRIGHTDATA_TOKEN`: Your Bright Data MCP server API token

### Configuration File (`config.yaml`)

The `config.yaml` in this plugin serves as a template. When you use `sam plugin add <component_name> --plugin bright-data`, the following placeholders in the YAML structure will be replaced with variations of `<component_name>`:
- `__COMPONENT_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_NAME__`
- `__COMPONENT_KEBAB_CASE_NAME__`
- `__COMPONENT_PASCAL_CASE_NAME__`

Customize the `config.yaml` in this plugin directory to define the base configuration for components created from it.

## Installation

To add this plugin to your SAM project, run the following command:

```bash
sam plugin add <your-new-component-name> --plugin git+https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins#subdirectory=bright-data
```

This will create a new component configuration at `configs/plugins/<your-new-component-name-kebab-case>.yaml`.

Alternatively, you can install via the SAM Plugin Catalog:

1. Launch SAM plugin catalog: `sam plugin catalog`
2. Add this repository to your SAM instance if you have not done so already: `+ Add Registry`, paste in the git repository [https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins](https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins) with name `Community`
3. Install the plugin using the install button in the GUI or with: `sam plugin add bright-data --plugin bright-data`
4. Configure required environment variables: `export BRIGHTDATA_TOKEN="your_api_key_here"`
