## Overview

The SendGrid plugin enables SAM to send emails programmatically through SendGrid's email delivery service. This allows you to automate email notifications, send transactional emails, and integrate email communications directly into your SAM workflows. The plugin provides a simple interface for composing and sending emails with full HTML support.

## Features

This agent provides the following capabilities:

- **Transactional Email**: Send automated transactional emails
- **HTML Email Support**: Send rich HTML-formatted emails
- **Template Support**: Use SendGrid email templates
- **Delivery Tracking**: Leverage SendGrid's delivery and engagement tracking
- **Reliable Delivery**: Built on SendGrid's robust email infrastructure

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Your SendGrid API key
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: The default sender email address

### Configuration File (`config.yaml`)

The `config.yaml` in this plugin serves as a template. When you use `sam plugin add <component_name> --plugin send-grid`, the following placeholders in the YAML structure will be replaced with variations of `<component_name>`:
- `__COMPONENT_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_NAME__`
- `__COMPONENT_KEBAB_CASE_NAME__`
- `__COMPONENT_PASCAL_CASE_NAME__`

Customize the `config.yaml` in this plugin directory to define the base configuration for components created from it.

## Installation

To add this plugin to your SAM project, run the following command:

```bash
sam plugin add <your-new-component-name> --plugin git+https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins#subdirectory=send-grid
```

This will create a new component configuration at `configs/plugins/<your-new-component-name-kebab-case>.yaml`.

Alternatively, you can install via the SAM Plugin Catalog:

1. Launch SAM plugin catalog: `sam plugin catalog`
2. Add this repository to your SAM instance if you have not done so already: `+ Add Registry`, paste in the git repository [https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins](https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins) with name `Community`
3. Install the plugin using the install button in the GUI or with: `sam plugin add send-grid --plugin send-grid`
4. Configure required environment variables (see Configuration section above)

## Usage

Once the agent is running, you can interact with it through the SAM orchestrator using natural language prompts to send emails.

### Example Prompts

- *"Send an email to user@example.com with the subject 'Welcome' and a greeting message"*
- *"Email the report to the team at team@company.com"*
- *"Send a notification email about the system update"*
- *"Compose and send a follow-up email to customer@example.com"*

## External Services

This plugin utilizes the following external service(s):

- **[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)**: Cloud-based email delivery platform

## Limitations
